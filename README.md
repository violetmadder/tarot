# tarot

Trying to practice some very basic python

Goal with this project is to create a JSON dictionary in a format that can be imported into kumu.io so I can see a floating visualization of all the various cards in a tarot deck, with multiple different versions of cards connected to each other so I can compare the artwork from different sets.
