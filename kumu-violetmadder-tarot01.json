At Der in Babylon, she devoured the phallic god Oannes and gave him rebirth, a myth later repeated as the biblical story of Jonah. Her card means irresistible power, a perilous compulsion, symbolized by another of her totems, the spider. Though risky, her path might bring great rewards."

As Morgan le Fay, or Morgana, third of the Fate trinity, she is the quintessential Crone. As Death, she is said to be stronger than any man. Her suit stands for the air element, home of bodiless souls who are sometimes supposed to ride the wind. Through dire in many predictions, the ace stands for release, new freedom, lifting of earthly restraints, lightness, a kind of salvation."

Folks that she saved would be the seeds of the next life. Thus, this conventional Judgment scene could be pagan, Christian, or even Hindu—the origin of all. It means final decisions, choices, resurrected hopes, help from higher-ups."

The Inquisitions’ nine swords stand for hatred, scandal, unreasoning violence, brutal neglect or abandonment, misery."

Mount Sinai, allegedly ascended by Moses, belonged to the Baal named Sin, Moon-god of the Sinai peninsula. He also ruled volcanoes, appearing (in biblical language) as a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud by day, and as “the Rock that begat thee.” Baal means “the Lord.” His card means rocklike stability, tenacity, reliability, heaviness, sternness, authority."

In ancient cyclic philosophies, each period of fulfillment was followed by a period of decline. The Goddess decreed the death of her lover the king, following him into the dark seclusion of the underworld. She removed one of her magic veils at each of the underworld’s seven gates. This was the real meaning of the Dance of the Seven Veils performed by the high priestess Salome (Salom, Peace) in Jerusalem (“the House of Salom”). “Peace” was the sacred king’s word of farewell. The fourth cup, overturned, is the cup of oncoming darkness, wintry stagnation, disillusion, disappointment, satiety, a negative part of the cycle."

Grail myths said Galahad reigned as a sacred king for a year and a day, and died at the altar as he saw the vision of the Grail. He was apotheosized, like the heroes shown on Elaine’s cauldron. He represents the best feminine qualities in man: gentleness, gallantry, sensitivity, courtesy, aspiration, capacity for self-sacrifice. He may be a messenger of new ideas."

He has no reins to control his contrasting-colored horses, which seem to be wandering off in opposite directions. Following the card of marriage, he represents youthful complacency and pride in life’s early successes, but his lack of reins hints that he is not in control of his fate. The ancients used chariot images to remind each triumphant hero that his glory couldn’t last forever. “The road of the chariot” also means the road to death. The tarot’s black and white horses (sometimes sphinxes) stand for uncontrollable drives and the vicissitudes of life. The Chariot means material success, achievement or transitory splendor, perhaps attended by brashness or arrogance."

As the tarot’s true Last Trump, this is the vision of a sage’s final moments, when he hopes to enter the being of the Great Shakti (Goddess). The tarot’s true message seems to be salvation through the female principle, “the Generative Womb of All, the Beginning and End of Beings.” The Goddess’s legs form the same figure as the Hanged Man’s, since she is the dancer in the heart known as the Female Soul. Her card is also called Shekina, Sophia, Eve, Truth, Mother Nature, the Bride, and the Universe. It is interpreted as completion, perfection, ultimate knowledge, true union, and return to vital beings."

His curious, long-brimmed hat traditionally shows a fleur-de-lis crown. Scepter and orb are male-and-female symbols of the sacred marriage between a male ruler and the Goddess of his land, which made it possible for him to rule. Barren mountains and a flight of carrion crows suggest the ruler’s eventual death when his powers fail. The Emperor stands for male authority, law-giving power, fatherhood, guidance, stern judgment, perhaps oppression or tyranny."

He stands for disillusion with a formerly revered cause, fruitless conflict, censure, embarrassment, false beliefs, spiritual pollution, bad news, retribution for unkindness."

The stars, the rocks, the trees, the flowers, fish and birds--all are our brothers and sisters in this dance of life. We human beings tend to forget this, as we pursue our own private agendas and believe we must fight to get what we need. But ultimately, our sense of separateness is just an illusion, manufactured by the narrow preoccupations of the mind. Now is the time to look at whether you are allowing yourself to receive the extraordinary gift of feeling \"at \"home\" wherever you are. If you are, be sure to take time to savor it so it can deepen and remain with you. If on the other hand you've been feeling like the world is out to get you, it's time to take a break. Go outside tonight and look at the stars.",

        "description": "A man dressed like the Fool hangs from a beam between two trees by one leg, the other leg bent in the Hermetic figure-4 position. His hands are bound behind his back, but his facial expression is peaceful. Bunches of grapes hang with him, suggesting sacraments of Dionysus. Two towers appear in a landscape like that of the Moon card. Hanging by one leg was the medieval custom of “baffling,” a nonlethal punishment bringing disgrace, like a sojourn in the stocks. Like the ritual humiliation in many types of initiation, this may have been a symbolic death-and-rebirth, designed to make the novice hear his own heartbeat, which Asian mystics called “the sound of power.” The basis of all rhythm, it is heard even by fetal ears in the womb. The heart’s inner “dance” was the dancing god in Chidambaram, the Cave of the Heart. In ancient Egypt, a figure with one leg bent like the Hanged Man’s was the hieroglyphic sign of dancing and of the Mother-given heart-soul (ab). The Hanged Man’s gallows dance is therefore a mock martyrdom, interpreted as a sacrifice for a good purpose, patient endurance, silent suffering, life at a low ebb."

It may have referred to medieval Europe’s ecclesiastical establishment, sometimes called the Proud Tower, as well as the House of God. A popular prophecy of the fourteenth century predicted destruction of the totalitarian Holy Roman Empire, church and state, by the enlightening lightning god Lucifer; thus, the two falling figures could be pope and emperor. The card refers to the overthrow of old, outworn habits by a new, perhaps painful readjustment, the destruction of pride, the sweeping away of too-rigid structures."

Standard symbols include his goat feet and horns, pointed ears, black candles, flaming torch, downward-pointing pentacle, and the finger-pose representing the horned head. As Lucifer, the Devil was revered by Gnostics who adopted the Persian idea that God and the Devil were twin brothers, the latter unjustly exiled from heaven by his tyrannical twin. Even the orthodox admitted that both were needed in their dualistic religion. If the bright deity was not to be held responsible for evil, then the dark deity had to be there to take the blame. The tarot Devil recalls the early mystery cults’ requisite meeting with the Lord of the Underworld, who would expound his secrets; he seems to be teaching. He represents physical and sexual forces, unconscious fears or desires, the power of the id, new self-knowledge in areas formerly suppressed."

The Papess is also identified with Sophia/Sapientia, the Gnostic Great Mother, who embodies Wisdom and provides God with his “I-deas” (Goddess-spirits) and ability to act. Thus, she is like the Asian goddess Shakti. She is especially linked with the moon, which was once thought to give women their life-producing “wise blood.” Her card means scholarship, teaching, revelation, entrance to the temple of Wisdom."

The two “feminine” elements of earth and water unite in an icon of the Goddess called Star (Astarte, Esther, Ostara, Astraea, Eostre, Stella Maris). Her personal priestesses were star-souls, the Seven Sisters (Pleiades), or Pillars of the Temple, or Seven Pillars of Wisdom, or (in India) the Seven Mothers of the Word. The Star means renewal of fertility, release of the waters of regeneration, blessings poured out on the world or within the soul."

Two acolytes kneel at his feet, corresponding to two devotees on the matching Devil card. As a holy man, the tarot’s Pope is identified as much with a pagan high priest, a hierophant, the Mithraic Pater Patri, or even the phallic father-god of Rome, as with the Christian pontiff. His card means spiritual authority, moral law, or political power plays; perhaps excessive rigidity or intolerance verging on fanaticism."

His blue skin was a conventional Asian sign of godhood, due to “blue blood,” which was also attributed even to Jehovah as the Gnostic Demiurge of “a dark blue complexion.” Yama’s male-and-female emblems of sword and lotus suggest regeneration, like the infinity sign. He stands for godlike authority, a powerful judge, discipline, order, obedience to the law of nature, and possibly dangerous inhumanity."

At this moment the Fool has the support of the universe to make this jump into the unknown. Adventures await him in the river of life. The card indicates that if you trust your intuition right now, your feeling of the 'rightness' of things, you cannot go wrong. Your actions may appear 'foolish' to others, or even to yourself, if you try to analyze them with the rational mind. But the 'zero' place occupied by the Fool is the numberless number where trust and innocence are the guides, not skepticism and past experience."

Like Gnostic Christians who revered the defeated Lucifer, “Light-bringer,” and regarded the triumphant deity as a tyrant, interpreters of the culminating card of the power suit recall that absolute power corrupts and leads to injustice. The ten might mean misuse of power, selfish authority, and too much pressure generating resentment and possible mutiny."

To overcome an impasse such as the five suggests, the six invokes a usable psychological technique: the inner return to childhood. Hidden memories of childhood impelled the ancients to visualize their divine ancestors as giants, which is how every child sees adults. Therefore the primal Great Mother was a giantess, a mountain, or a pyramidal tomb-womb, in humanity’s legendary Golden Age (the period of dependency), when law was based on maternal blood bonds. Such a psychic return means deep memory, old fears, loves, and longings, living in the past or searching the past for help, seeking Mother-wisdom."

Called the dogs of Hecate in Greece, Anubis-jackals in Egypt, lunar wolves or Moon-dogs in the north, two canines traditionally guard the gates of death, which leads to the moon. It was once thought all souls went to the Moon-mother to be regenerated. Hence the blood drops: one for each “hidden” menstrual period, as moon-blood forms new life in the womb. The crab is a more universal death symbol. The ancient world everywhere believed doomsday would come when the planets lined up in the constellation of Cancer, the Crab. This idea may have contributed to general fear of the Moon card, called a crisis of faith, a dark night of the soul, intimations of destruction, terror of the unknown."

The card’s corners bear symbols of the four elements and the four seasonal turning points of the zodiacal wheel: lion, bull, eagle, angel. The sky shows part of the galactic star-wheel (Milky Way) once thought to have poured from the Goddess’s breasts (Greek gala means “mother’s milk”). The Wheel represents a turning point in time, the change of every fortune, and signals a shift from the material sphere (first half of the Major Arcana) to the spiritual or subconscious sphere (second half), the realm of deeper secrets. It brings a change in outlook, unfamiliar territory, a reversal of direction.",

The masked and costumed Death figure, also called Macabre, performed the danse macabre as a stock character in medieval mystery plays. His tarot card was often unlabeled, due to a superstitious belief that to speak or write Death’s name was to invoke him. His “unlucky” number 13 refers to the last lunar month, which leads to a new cycle of rebirth. His card means an end leading to another beginning, transformation, change, or destruction.",

After the sacred marriage, ancient kings often ruled only for a predetermined time, then served as ceremonial victims for the sake of fertility, or to absolve the sins of others. Shiva became the bridegroom first, then the Condemned One. A rite like his svayamara or love-death survived in the British Isles as a mummer’s dance called the Rose: five men with swords or rods danced around a symbolically slain “Fool.” Five wands imply powerlessness in the suit of power. Security fails. The impasse seems hopeless, though this may be an illusion."

This is the deck I personally use the most for readings and practice. \n\nThe imagery is a radical departure from Waite-Smith symbolism, redefining suits and interpreting entirely new names and concepts for the cards. However, there remain very tantalizing, subtle common threads that relate to the traditional meanings-- which is why I use this deck, because when I compare these cards to the older versions, my mind starts to sizzle with interesting associations and ideas. That's where the rubber meets the road for me, teasing out connections from my subconscious that lead to some rich meditation.",
